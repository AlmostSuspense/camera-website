# How to Contribute
Siege is an always-evolving game, especially with the [frequency](https://staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5duaCdl3M0Cz6Wcfi4AHMx/b89150cfabc521480076b9d55aa84290/R6S_Y7_Roadmap_1920x1080_US.jpg) of content updates Ubisoft releases. As such, it might be hard to always keep the bot entirely up-to-date. This is why I'll be accepting contributions from the community to improve, update or rectify the data used throughout the bot. 

There are different types of accepted contributions:
- Adding a counter or synergy to an operator
- Adding "tips" (also called "strategies" in the code)

### Example: Strategies 
This game is built on strategies, lots of them being complex to a new player's eye. The idea would be to have simple tips added to the operator profile (`/operator`) that new players can use to get better at the game.

# How to Contribute
Siege is an always-evolving game, especially with the [frequency](https://staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5duaCdl3M0Cz6Wcfi4AHMx/b89150cfabc521480076b9d55aa84290/R6S_Y7_Roadmap_1920x1080_US.jpg) of content updates Ubisoft releases. As such, it might be hard to always keep the bot entirely up-to-date. This is why I'll be accepting contributions from the community to improve, update or rectify the data used throughout the bot. 

### Examples of Contributions
- **Strategies**: This game is built on strategies, lots of them being complex to a new player's eye. The idea would be to have simple tips added to the operator profile (`/operator`) that new players can use to get better at the game.
- **Polls**: In order to power an upcoming command, you can suggest questions around the game that the bot would ask players to start little debates (eg. is Tower a good map?)
- **Funfacts:** I also accept funfact suggestions to be added to the command with the same name. There are currently three fact categories: lore, operators and maps.
- **Links:** You can also suggest links to be added to the `/links` command, note that they must have a reasonable link to the game in general.
- **Operator Data:** If you think an operator is missing information such as counters or synergies, please suggest some changes!

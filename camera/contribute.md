# How to Contribute
Siege is an always-evolving game, especially with the [frequency](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/roadmap) of content updates Ubisoft puts out. As such, it might be hard to always keep the bot entirely up-to-date. This is why I'm open to contributions from the community to improve and update the intel used throughout Camera.

### Examples of Contributions
- **Strategies**: This game is built on strategies, lots of them being complex to a new player's eye. The idea would be to have simple tips added to the operator profile (`/operator`) that new players can use to get better at the game.
- **Polls**: You can suggest questions around the game that the bot would ask players to start debates (eg. *is Tower a good map?*)
- **Hot Takes**: Spicy opinions for the `/hot-take` command.
- **Funfacts:** I also accept funfact suggestions to be added to the command with the same name.
- **Links:** You can also suggest links to be added to the `/links` command, note that they must have a reasonable link to the game.
- **Quotes**: Camera uses operator quotes as its live status on Discord
- **Operator Data:** If you think an operator is missing information such as counters, synergies, tips, etc.. please suggest some changes!

# Camera — Privacy Policy
**Effective Date**: September 1st, 2022
**Last Updated**: August 31st, 2024

Camera (also referred to as “the camera bot”, “it” or Camera#4879) is a Discord bot based around [Rainbow Six: Siege](https://ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege). Camera helps you get into the universe of Siege — learn the operators, maps, gadgets, and start climbing the rank ladder!

### Data Storing
By default, Camera does not store any data. But if we detect abuse and need to prevent it, we might start storing your user id for as long as necessary.

### Logging
To learn how you use Camera and in order to improve it, Camera tracks various usage action from users. The term “actions” refers to interactions with the bot, such as using a command or adding/removing it from a server. Logging consists of sending a message in a channel only the bot's Staff has access to. Our logs contain the following information:

- User profile information: username, user id and client locale
- Where and when the interaction took place: guild name, guild id, channel name, channel id and timestamp
- Additional details about the interaction (such as, but not limited to, "used a command" or "added the bot to a server")

### Data Deletion
Due to the nature of the logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete log entries. Additonally, since the only data we might store about users is their unique user id to prevent abuse, it is necessary for the bot to operate and thus not something you can request the deletion of. 

### Questions
If you have any questions about the bot or this policy, don't hesitate to reach out in the [support server](https://suspense.is-a.dev/support) and detail your concern in the `#support` channel.

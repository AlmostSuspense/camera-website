# Camera — Privacy Policy
**Effective Date**: September 1st, 2022

Camera (also referred to as “the camera bot”, “it” or Camera#4879) is a Discord bot based around [Rainbow Six: Siege](https://ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) which is mostly aimed at new players to help them understand the numerous complex elements that make the game so unique. 

### Data Storing
By default, Camera does not store any data. But if we detect abuse and need to prevent it, we might start storing your user id for as long as necessary.

### Logging
To power analytical features, Camera tracks actions users take when using the bot. The term “actions” represents interactions with the bot that result in responses, like using a command. Logging is done by sending a message in a private channel only the bot's staff has access to, containing basic information about your profile (username, discriminator, user id and client locale) and a brief description of what you did (for example, used a command). 

### Data Deleteion
Due to the nature of the logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete them. Additonally, since the only data we might store about users is their user id to prevent abuse, it is necessary for the bot to work and thus not something you can request the deletion of. 

### Questions
If you have any questions about the bot or this privacy policy, don't hesitate to reach out in our [support server](https://suspense.is-a.dev/support) and detail your problem in the `#support` channel.

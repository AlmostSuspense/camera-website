# Camera — Privacy Policy
**Last Updated**: August 27th, 2022

Camera (also referred to as “the camera bot”, “it” or Camera#4879) is a Discord bot based around [Rainbow Six: Siege](https://ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) which is mostly aimed at new players to help them under the numerous complex elements that make the game so unique. 

### Data Storing
Camera does not store any data. 

### Logging
To power analytical features, Camera tracks actions users take when using the bot. The term “actions” represents interactions with the bot that result in responses, like using a command. Logging is done by sending a message in a private channel only the bot's staff has access to, containing basic information about your profile (username, discriminator, user id and client locale) and a brief description of what you did (for example, used a command). Due to the nature of this logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete them.

### Questions
If you have any questions about the bot or this privacy policy, don't hesitate to reach out in our [support server](https://suspense.is-a.dev/support) and detail your problem in the `#support` channel.

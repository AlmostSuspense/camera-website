# Camera — Privacy Policy
**Last Updated**: August 27th, 2022

Camera (also referred to as “the camera bot”, “it” or Camera#4879) is a Discord bot based around [Rainbow Six: Siege](https://ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) which is mostly aimed at new players to help them under the numerous complex elements that make the game so unique. 

### Data Handling & Logging
Camera currently does not store user data. However, to power analytical features, it includes tracking of actions user take when using the bot. The term “actions” mostly represents interactions with the bot that result in responses. Logged content contains basic information about your profile (username, discriminator and user id) and a brief description of what you did (for example, used a command). Due to the nature of this logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete them. Only the bot's Staff members have access to the logged data.

### Questions
If you have any questions about the bot, please join the [support server](https://suspense.is-a.dev/support) and detail your problem in the `#support` channel.

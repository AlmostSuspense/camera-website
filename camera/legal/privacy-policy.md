Camera (or @Camera#4879) is a Discord companion application based around [Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege](https://ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege). Camera helps you get into the universe of Siege — learn the operators, maps, gadgets, and start climbing the rank ladder!

### Data Storing
To power analytics, Camera will update a numeric counter when you use perform various actions on the bot, such as using a command or clicking a button. Unless stated otherwise in the exceptions list below, this is only a numeric counter going up and cannot be traced back to you.

- For the `/search` command, queries are stored in order to improve results and gauge interest.
- If you are found to abuse Camera, we might store your unique user identifier.

### Logging
To learn how you use Camera and in order to improve it, Camera tracks various usage action from users. The term “actions” refers to interactions with the bot, such as using a command or adding/removing it from a server. Logging consists of sending a message in a channel only the bot's Staff has access to. Our logs contain the following information:

- User profile information: username, user id and Discord locale
- Where and when the interaction took place: guild name, guild id, channel name, channel id and timestamp
- Additional details about the interaction (such as, but not limited to, "used a command" or "added the bot to a server")

### Data Deletion
Due to the nature of the logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete log entries. Additonally, since the only data we might store about users is their unique user identifier to prevent abuse, it is necessary for the bot to operate and thus not something you can request the deletion of.
